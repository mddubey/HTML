				The City Police on Sunday evening shut down 1,037 automated teller machine (ATM) kiosks that did not comply with security measures announced by Home Minister K J George on November 21.
			</p>
			<p>
				The police on Thursday released three-point security measures to be incorporated into each of the 2,580 ATMs in the City. The steps were appointing security guards 24x7, installing burglar alarms and CCTV cameras to capture visuals inside and outside the ATM kiosks. All these were to be completed by 4 pm on Sunday.

				While banks balked at the idea of getting all this in place in three days, the police remained firm. Police Commissioner Raghavendra Auradkar told Deccan Herald that they had given banks a long rope and sufficient time to act. “We decided to act as most of them had not complied with the orders,” he said.

				The police, who had identified the ATMs, had the bank officials lock them and served a notice on the officials. Where bank officials were not available, police themselves closed the kiosks and pasted notices.
