					After a series of disappointing performances, West Indies managed to get their act together to notch up their maiden win on this short tour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having put up a disciplined bowling show to restrict India to a below-par 288 for seven, the visiting batsmen finally came to the party as.

					At the end of the 40th over, India held majority of the aces with West Indies still needing 84 from the final 10 overs and the last recognised batting pair at the crease. But Lendl Simmons (62, 74b, 5x4, 1x6), dropped on 43 by Yuvraj Singh, and Darren Sammy (63 n.o., 45b, 4x4, 4x6) forged a crucial 75-ball.

					The fielding, and particularly catching, from either team was of poor standard. India grassed at least four catches, which if held could have changed the course of the game. The three wickets in 13 balls towards the end did cause some tension but it was a case of too little and too late.

					It was a testimony to India’s batting strength that despite Rohit Sharma’s rare failure, Shikhar Dhawan’s early dismissal, the continued struggles of Yuvraj and Suresh Raina in the middle order and a mere 15 runs in the batting Power Play, the hosts stacked up a near 300 total. Virat Kohli (99, 100b, 9x4) was unlucky to miss out on his 18th century in the 50-over format by just one run but his knock, along with the customary flourish towards the backend by MS Dhoni (51 n.o., 40b, 3x4, 4x6), powered India to a challenging score.

					Having received a reprieve on 64 by Windies’ skipper Dwayne Bravo off his own bowling, the 25-year-old added a further 35 before a brilliant catch by Jason Holder left the capacity crowd heart-broken. But it wasn’t long before Dhoni had them all eating out of his hands. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Indian skipper had taken 18 balls for his first four runs but he rattled off his next 46 runs in just 21 balls to reach his half-century. With Ashwin clubbing 19 off 10, the last five overs yielded 62.

					Asked to bat first, India had been reduced to 69/2 following the exit of both the openers and it was on the back of Kohli’s sagacity and solidity that the home side clawed its way back into the match. While providing stability to the innings, the stylish batsman stayed on top of the attack to help India re-establish their control over proceedings. His partnerships with Dhawan (48), Yuvraj (65) and Raina (62) ensured that West Indies were unable to exert pressure every time they found a breakthrough.
