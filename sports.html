					After a series of disappointing performances, West Indies managed to get their act together to notch up their maiden win on this short tour.
				</p>

					Having put up a disciplined bowling show to restrict India to a below-par 288 for seven, the visiting batsmen finally came to the party as they overhauled hosts.

					At the end of the 40th over, India held majority of the aces with West Indies still needing 84 from the final 10 overs and the last recognised batting pair at the crease. But Lendl Simmons (62, 74b, 5x4, 1x6), dropped on 43 by Yuvraj Singh, and Darren Sammy (63 n.o., 45b, 4x4, 4x6) forged a crucial 75-ball.

					The fielding, and particularly catching, from either team was of poor standard. India grassed at least four catches, which if held could have changed the course of the game. The three wickets in 13 balls towards the end did cause some tension but it was a case of too little and too late.
